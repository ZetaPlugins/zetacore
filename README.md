# ZetaCore

ZetaCore is a lightweight Minecraft (Paper) plugin framework designed to streamline plugin development. It replaces verbose boilerplate with clean, annotation-based command and tab-completion registration. No more plugin.yml definitions. ZetaCore also provides consistent message formatting utilities, type-safe configuration mapped directly to Java classes, built-in localization support, simple but powerful dependency injection, and a collection of helpful utilities for modern Paper plugins.
